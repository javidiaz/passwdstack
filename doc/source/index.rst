Welcome to FuturGrid PasswdStack
================================
PasswdStack is a simple tool that allows regular users to reset their own password in the OpenStack Dashboard. Currently, OpenStack does
not allow regular users to change their own password in the dashboard. This tool tackles this problem. The security is done via LDAP in the server
side, which guarantees that an user can only change its own password.
